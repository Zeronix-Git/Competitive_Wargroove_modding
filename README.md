# Analysis Mod
This mod allows players to undo moves within a turn, letting them explore different options. 

### Features
- Undo action used at HQ to undo your last move

### Installation
Download the zip from Github and extract the contents. Drag the mod folder onto your wargroove-mod-packer.exe to install the mod. 

### Feature Wishlist
- Add a means of setting the damage for the next attack. A simple option could be "min / avg / max"; a more advanced option would be setting the exact RNG roll or exact damage value
- Allow "free moves" in case we forgot to move / build certain units
- Allow "delete unit" in case we forgot to kill a unit

# Competitive Wargroove modding
A mod for competitive Wargroove play. 

### Current Features
- No RNG. (Note: If you have "display damage range" turned on in settings, you'll still see a damage range, but the actual damage will have no RNG.)

### Installation
Download the zip from Github and extract the contents. Drag the mod folder onto your wargroove-mod-packer.exe to install the mod. 

### Feature Wishlist
These are features that would be nice to have. They may or may not get implemented at some point in the future. 
- Turn timer
- Ability to undo move
- Saving replays with some sort of log
- Allow damage calculation on units not within attack range
